# What Drives the Price of a Used Car?

## What This Is

We looked at data from over 426,000 used car listings to answer one question: **what makes a used car worth more or less?** The goal is to give you, as a dealer, a clear picture of what your customers are willing to pay more for — so you can stock smarter and price better.

The detailed analysis is in the notebook: [`prompt_II.ipynb`](prompt_II.ipynb)

## What We Found

After crunching the numbers, here are the biggest factors that drive what a used car sells for, ranked from most to least important:

| # | What Matters | Why It Matters |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **How new the car is** | This is the single biggest factor. A 3-year-old car will outsell a 10-year-old car by a wide margin, every time. |
| 2 | **How many miles are on it** | Buyers pay close attention to the odometer. Low-mileage cars bring in significantly more money. |
| 3 | **Engine size** | Bigger engines (more cylinders) mean higher prices. Think V8s over 4-cylinders. |
| 4 | **Diesel fuel type** | Diesel vehicles — especially trucks — consistently sell at a premium over gas. |
| 5 | **Pickups and SUVs** | These vehicle types bring in more money than sedans or hatchbacks. |
| 6 | **Condition** | A car listed as "excellent" or "like new" sells for noticeably more than one listed as just "good" or "fair." |
| 7 | **Clean title** | Salvage or rebuilt titles can knock thousands off the price. Clean title is a must for top dollar. |

## What You Should Do

Here are five things you can act on right away:

1. **Buy newer, low-mileage cars whenever possible.** These are your bread and butter — age and miles are the two biggest price drivers by far.

2. **Make room for diesel pickups and SUVs.** They consistently sell at higher prices and are worth the investment to acquire.

3. **Spend money on detailing and reconditioning.** Getting a car from "good" to "excellent" condition pays for itself in the higher sale price.

4. **Stick to clean titles.** If you do take in a salvage or rebuilt title vehicle, know that the market will heavily discount it — price your purchase accordingly.

5. **Pay attention to the brand.** Toyota, Ram, and GMC hold their value better than most. Economy brands lose value faster.
